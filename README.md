## Objective
For any Machine learning task, the most important step is to prepare data i.e. train and test directories for the model to train and validate on. This repo exactly does this
for the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset (famous cats-dogs dataset) that can be downloaded here https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/

## Learning  
My aim behind working this out was to understand the Image Segmentation task and the complexty behind it. And also practise to write a clean and concise code that is easier to debug.

## Challenges
The main challenge I faced was when I was translating the visualization code in julia. It was a little tricky to draw segmentation annotations on the image, it was not as straight forward as it was in python.

## Languages used
- Python 3.8
- Julia 1.6
